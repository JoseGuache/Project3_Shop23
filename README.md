# Project 3: Shop 23

## Description

For this project, our team developed a fully functional e-commerce web application specializing in the sale of Jordan-brand sneakers for men, women, and children. The application provides a seamless shopping experience, allowing users to browse a curated selection of shoes, add items to their cart, adjust quantities, remove products, and proceed to checkout. To complete a purchase, users must have an account and be signed in, ensuring a secure transaction process. This project showcases our ability to design and implement a user-friendly and efficient online shopping platform.
